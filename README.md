Reusable service provider to communicate with backend
Recently I have finished a very large web application using angularjs and JAVA backend. The mechanisem of our project is using controllers in JAVA and communicate with frontend with angularjs service providers.

As there is too many controllers instead of create a service for each client controller we have decided to generate a generic service so angularjs controller just pass the URL and params to service and it communicate with JAVA controller and respond to client controller.
